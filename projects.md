My work involved the back-end development of the communication services used by the customers,
drivers and company employees to communicate through the app.

### Niometrics (now Mobileum)

### Master thesis - Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica


> Most of the real-world physical phenomena can be described by mathematical models governed by partial differential equations (PDE). 
> These differential equations might be too complex to be solved analytically, therefore requiring advanced computational capabilities 
> to be solved numerically. This defines the field of Scientific Computing. 
> The main drawbacks lies in the fact that these Full-Order Models (FOM) require large range of parameters, 
> solved on high-dimensional grid and using small time steps to performed accurate simulations able to capture the sharpest details,
> such that the computational resources involved are a bottleneck on large-scale application. 
> Multiples methods of Model Order Reduction (MOR) were implemented to avoid these difficulties. 
> Instead of solving the FOM, these are Reduced order models (ROM), able to capture the main dynamics 
> while reducing the complexity of the system, which are numerically solved. 
> These ROM usually trade accuracy for time complexity and require a closure term to capture the information 
> loss which occurred when reducing the system. In the past decade, 
> the progress in the field of machine learning brings to light new techniques either to 
> learn these closure terms or to learn new type of ROM, such as the right-hand side of a PDE.

> This thesis, beside reviewing the existing MOR methods, aims at assessing some of the machine learning techniques which 
> rise in the recent years applied to simple linear and non-linear PDEs on coarse grid. 
> It investigates how models should be adapted to the problem considered, how to parameterize them to accurately approximate the FOM, 
> with an emphasis on the inverse problem aspect of the methods employed during training.

### H2VK - Vulkan based educational graphic engine

Personal project done to refresh knowledge with modern C++17, gather knowledge about the Vulkan cross-platform API and work with GPU.
A long term goal would be to render fluid flows solutions combined with PINN.
